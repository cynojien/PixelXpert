The plan is to finagle this to work on LineageOS again.


I don't have much experience with any of this. It's going to be a hack 'n slash. Don't expect everything to work... or anything for that matter

Every Action will fail because I don't care to update some of the build scripts. It is making artificats.

!!!Currently it is still causing SystemUI loops. Don't bother with this for now. Probably shouldn't use it even after I get it to not crash. ;)
